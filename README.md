# Slay-the-Spire-Mycologist-Mod

Inspired by fellow roguelike deckbuuilding game Inscryption and it's mycologist in-game feature, this mod seeks to add a similar gameplay mechanic at rest sites whereby players can choose to fuse two of the same cards into a single card with the same cost, but combined power/effects.
